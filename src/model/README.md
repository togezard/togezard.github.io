# Model Layer

The Model layer in this application is responsible for handling data structures and the business logic involved in the application's domain. This layer provides a clear separation between the data representation and the user interface, ensuring that the core functionality is encapsulated and modular.

## Responsibilities
- **Data Structures**: Defines the entities and their relationships required for the business application.
- **Business Logic**: Implements the rules and processes that govern how data can be created, stored, and modified.

## Key Components
1. **Entities**: These are the main data structures that represent the key concepts in the application.
2. **Repositories**: Data access layers that handle CRUD operations for the entities.
3. **Services**: Provide business operations that retrieve or manipulate data across one or more entities.

## Usage
The Model layer should be utilized by other layers of the application to perform operations related to data management and business processes. Each component within this layer should promote reusability and maintainability, following the principles of clean architecture.
